# Dice_roller
Each player rolls two dice and writes the highest value number that you can make with the two numbers on the dice. For instance, if a player rolls a 6 and a 1, they would write “61”. The next player rolls the dice and tries to beat that number. The player with the highest number on a round, scores a point.
